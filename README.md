<h1>ISS Overhead Notifier</h1>

This Python script tracks the International Space Station (ISS) and sends an email notification when the ISS is passing over your specified location during nighttime. It uses the requests library to fetch ISS and sunrise/sunset data, smtplib to send emails, and the datetime and time libraries for time-related operations.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 33.
